# 🚀 My DSA Journey  

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository**! 🎯  
This repo contains my complete learning journey in **DSA using C++**, with codes, explanations, and practice problems.  

---

## 📖 About This Repo  
- A collection of all **DSA topics I have learned and implemented**.  
- Written in **simple, beginner-friendly C++**.  
- Includes both **basic concepts and advanced problems**.  
- Acts as a **reference guide** for me and for anyone starting DSA.

## 🌱 My DSA Learning Path  
I started with the **basics of programming** and then gradually moved through every core topic of DSA:  

- ✅ Arrays & Strings  
- ✅ Stack & Queue  
- ✅ Linked List (Singly, Doubly, Circular)  
- ✅ Trees (Binary Tree, BST, AVL, Heap)  
- ✅ Graphs (BFS, DFS, Shortest Path, MST)  
- ✅ Hashing & Hash Tables  
- ✅ Recursion & Backtracking  
- ✅ Divide and Conquer  
- ✅ Greedy Algorithms  
- ✅ Dynamic Programming  

Now I feel confident in solving **coding problems and competitive programming challenges**. 🚀

## 🛠 Language & Tools  
- **C++** (main language for implementation)  
- **STL (Standard Template Library)** for quick coding  
- **Custom implementations** to strengthen understanding
